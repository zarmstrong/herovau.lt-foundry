## More in depth description:
This module provides an integration with the herovau.lt website.  A (free) account on herovau.lt is required for any user wishing to use the vault.  The vault can store up to 10 PCs for free, or unlimited PCs for subscribers. These PCs can be moved between servers by either downloading the character exports directly from HeroVau.lt or by using this module.

---
### Current features:
 - The ability to import PCs from HeroVau.lt
 - The ability to add a token to a PC that can be used universally across servers. (available on herovau.lt)
 - The ability to export PCs.
 - The exporter attempts to download portrait/token art from servers when you export a PC from Foundry using this module.
 - PF2e: You can now attempt to import PCs via PFS #.  Currently, it only searches for HeroVau.lt PCs that have PFS information saved on their character.

### Planned features:
 
 - Some secret stuff that is tentative.
 - Submit your ideas ![here](https://github.com/zarmstrong/herovau.lt-foundry/issues)!
